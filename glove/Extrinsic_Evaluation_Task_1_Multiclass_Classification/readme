This is a readme file directing you how to execute the task of evaluation of embeddings on Multiclass classification task.

Files present in directory:
get_business_text.py
preprocess_text.py
run.py

Description of what each file does:
1. get_business_text.py
It extracts the business section text from all files present in the 10-k data directory. It preprocess the text and then saves it
as a new column in the dataframe. Thus, each row corresponding to each file now also has the corresponding business text in the dataframe.
The dataframe is written back to the specified location.
The directions to run the file and the necessary arguments are present in file itself.

2. preprocess_text.py
It is the customized code for preprocessing the business text. This is used as a module in above code get_business_text.py.
Users don't need to run it seperately.

3. run.py
This is the most important file which actually prepares the data and trains the model on the data. User need to specify the path to 
the dataframe and the glove dictionary(pre-trained or one trained by us). Output of the file will be the accuracy list in python which has
test accuracy values for specified number of epochs. User can analyse it and use for plotting to see the results of evaluation.
